# Challenge 7: hello classes

- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Write a program that can read in a comma separated value file (a csv file). Make a data model (a class) to 
hold the lines and print out only one particular piece of information. So we are expecting getter and 
setter methods. Students should also be able to explain what a method signature is. Ideally, the
solution for this challenge also consists out of multiple classes.

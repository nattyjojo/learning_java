- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Create a small application that will assign and print out an example of all the primitive data types in Java.
hint: None of these datatypes have a capital letter. 

### Extra

- How come you can just print all of these datatypes? 
- Why are those called primitive data types?
- Why can't you assign a double to an integer?
- But why can you assign an integer to a char?
- Why can't you assign a long to a int?

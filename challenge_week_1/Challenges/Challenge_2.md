# Hello data types pt2 

- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Create the same application but now with the object version of these data types. What is the difference?

- These are objects. Primitive data types are raw values, but objects are not. Objects are actually pointers,
  they point to memory in the jvm. So a variable of type Integer can also NOT have a pointer, which makes it 'null'.
- Very extra: Is there a way to loop over all of the variables automatically and only have 1 print statement? If so, 
  why was this not possible the primitive datatypes?

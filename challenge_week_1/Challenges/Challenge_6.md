# Challenge 6: Counting letters

- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Write a program that reads in a text file and then counts the appearance of letters line by line. The result 
should be an overview of how many times each letter (or should we go for character?) appeared.

## Challenge 6 bis: most frequent letter

The same as challenge 6, but also report which is the most commonly used letter.

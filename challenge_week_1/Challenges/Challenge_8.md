# Challenge 8: Hello classes part 2

- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Again write a program that can read a comma separated value file. Each row of this file contains some information
that has its own meaning and value separate, but it can also have value when combined with other fields. For example
each row of a cvs file can represent a day and count of visitors/patients per department in a hospital. For example on 27-07-2021, 
there are 40 visitor for cardiology, 98 for radiology, 1120 people just visiting somebody in the hospital, etc etc. The students
need to make classes that model the file, but they also add behaviour to that class that operates on the data that it contains.
In other words, we are setting the first encapsulation steps.  ---- > maybe a bit too early to call it out already.

we want to be able to 'report' per day and per month, these reports are written in files. So we will be needing multiple classes 
to do this, also making them write to files.

# Challenge 10: Hello generics

- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo & team of 2`

  

## The Mission

Create a program that has 2 classes: Car and Truck. Give them both a field `int numberOfWheels` and write a 
getter method for that. Now in your program, try to create a collection (can be List, a Set, anything) that holds
an object of both classes. How would you do that? 

## Bonus

### Teamwork: Counting appearance of words in a folder filled with text files

Pair up. The goal is to create a report of the amount of times certain words (sequences of characters) appear
in all the different files. How are you going to divide the work?

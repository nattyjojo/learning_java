# Challenge 5: Counting words

- Repository: `java_week_1`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Write a program that reads in a text file and then counts the appearance of words line by line. The result should 
be an overview of how many times each word was in the text. 

## Challenge 5 bis: Most frequently used word

The same as challenge 5, but now we also want to know which word was used the most.
